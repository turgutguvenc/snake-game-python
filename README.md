# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the turtle graphics module.

## Description

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

The game features a snake that moves around the screen, a randomly generated food item, and a scoreboard to keep track of the player's score.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
3. Guide the snake to eat the food items to grow longer and earn points.
4. Avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.
6. After the game ends, the final score will be displayed.

## Dependencies

The game requires the `turtle` module, which is a part of the Python standard library. No additional installations are needed.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script that initializes the game and sets up the game window.
